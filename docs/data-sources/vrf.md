# hyperfabric_vrf

Data source for a VRF in a Nexus Hyperfabric Fabric

A VRF is a virtual-routing-and-forwarding instance that represents a routing table deployed across Nodes in the Fabric to implement VRF-lite and the ability to have multiple routing tables on a single Device. A VRF can be associated to multiple VNIs configured with an Anycast Gateway SVI.

## API Paths ##

* `/fabrics/{fabricId|fabricName}/vrfs/{vrfId|name}` `GET`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `> Fabrics > {fabric} > Logical network > Route tables (VRF)`

## Example Usage ##

```hcl
data "hyperfabric_vrf" "example_vrf" {
  fabric_id = hyperfabric_fabric.example_fabric.id
  name      = "my-example-vrf"
}
```

## Schema ##

* `description` - (string) The description is a user defined field to store notes about the VRF.
* `asn` - (integer) The Autonomous System Number (ASN) used for the VRF external connections.
* `vni` - (integer) The VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) used for the VRF.
* `labels` - (list of strings) A list of user-defined labels that can be used for grouping and filtering objects.
* `annotations` - (list of maps) A list of key-value annotations to store user-defined data including complex data such as JSON.
